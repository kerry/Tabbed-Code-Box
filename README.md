# tabbed_code-box


#Info

This uses version 1.0 of ZeroClipboard library to enable copy function. ZeroClipboard uses flash to achieve this.

#Installation instructions

1. Copy or clone the files to your working directory.
2. Host the files on a server, just opening index.html file in the browser will only give you tab functions but will not be able to provide copy function.
3. To use this with multiple code-boxes, just change the div id that is supplied when the code-copy button is pressed. Rest all will work fine.
